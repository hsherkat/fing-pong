This is a simple Pong-eqsue game you play with your hands. It requires a webcam. A paddle should appear between the tips of your thumb and forefinger when you hold up your hand.

Within a span of a couple days, I saw a demo of the MediaPipe Hands tracker, as well as a [tutorial](https://realpython.com/asteroids-game-python/) on making an Asteroids-esque game using pygame, and I was inspired to make this (primarily because the name occurred to me). Much of the game code was inspired by or cannibalized from the tutorial.

The hand tracking doesn't work as well as I've seen in other instances of MediaPipe Hands being used; I'm not sure why. It could be my webcam -- hopefully it works better for you!
